# Netlify Deployment Debug Guide

## Issues Identified

Your app at `homeboom.netlify.app` is experiencing several issues:

### âœ… FIXED Issues:
1. **PWA Manifest Icon Error** - Fixed by creating proper icon files
2. **Placeholder Image 404s** - Fixed by replacing broken Unsplash URLs 
3. **Debug Console Logs** - Removed production console.log statements

### ðŸ”§ REMAINING Issue:
**Netlify Functions 404 Errors** (`/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, etc.)

## Root Cause Analysis

The Netlify functions exist and are properly configured in `netlify.toml`, but they're returning 404 errors because **Firebase environment variables are not configured in your Netlify deployment**.

The functions require these environment variables:
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` 
- `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`

## Solution Steps

### 1. Set Netlify Environment Variables

Go to your Netlify dashboard â†’ Site settings â†’ Environment variables and add:

```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-firebase-service-account-email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYour\nPrivate\nKey\nHere\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
```

**Important:** The private key must include the literal `\n` characters for line breaks.

### 2. Deploy the Latest Changes

After setting environment variables, trigger a new deployment:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix PWA icons and image placeholders"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Test Functions

Once deployed with environment variables, test:
- `https://homeboom.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/auth-login`
- `https://homeboom.netlify.app/api/auth/login` (should redirect to function)

### 4. Alternative: Use Development Mode

If you can't set up Firebase immediately, you can temporarily modify the functions to use a fallback storage mechanism or mock data for testing.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] All PWA icons exist and load correctly
- [ ] No more placeholder image 404 errors
- [ ] Firebase environment variables set in Netlify
- [ ] Functions return proper responses (not 404)
- [ ] Authentication flow works end-to-end

## Next Steps

1. Set the Firebase environment variables in Netlify
2. Redeploy the site
3. Test the authentication flow
4. Monitor function logs in Netlify dashboard

If you continue to have issues, check the function logs in your Netlify dashboard under Functions â†’ View logs.
