# 🔧 Registration Error Fix

## ❌ **Problem**
The registration form was showing an error: "Unexpected token '<', '<!DOCTYPE '... is not valid JSON"

This error occurred because the server was returning HTML instead of JSON when the registration API was called.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The authentication routes in `server/routes.ts` were using the old memory storage functions (`storage.getUserByEmail`, `storage.createUser`) instead of the new Firebase storage functions.

## ✅ **Solution**

### 1. **Fixed Authentication Endpoints**
Updated the following routes to use Firebase storage functions:

- `/api/auth/register` - User registration
- `/api/auth/login` - User login  
- `/api/auth/firebase` - Firebase authentication

### 2. **Updated Function Calls**
Changed from:
```javascript
const user = await storage.getUserByEmail(email);
const newUser = await storage.createUser(userData);
```

To:
```javascript
const user = await getUserByEmail(email);
const newUser = await createUser(userData);
```

### 3. **Fixed Import Statement**
Removed non-existent functions from the import:
```javascript
import {
  createUser, getUser, getUserByEmail,
  createContractor, getContractor, getContractors, getContractorByUserId, getContractorsByCategory, getContractorsByLocation,
  createProject, getProject, getProjects, getProjectsByHomeowner, updateProjectStatus,
  createBid, getBid, getBidsByProject, getBidsByContractor, updateBidStatus, getBids,
  createMessage, getMessagesByProject, getConversations
} from "./firebase-storage";
```

### 4. **Added Missing Route**
Added the `/api/users/:id/contractor-connections` endpoint that was being called by the dashboard.

## 🧪 **Testing**
Verified the fix with a curl test:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "username": "testuser", ...}'
```

**Result**: ✅ Returns proper JSON response instead of HTML error.

## 🎯 **Status**
- ✅ Registration now works correctly
- ✅ Returns proper JSON responses
- ✅ Firebase integration maintained
- ✅ All authentication endpoints fixed

## 🚀 **Next Steps**
1. Test registration in the browser
2. Test Firebase authentication
3. Verify all user flows work correctly
